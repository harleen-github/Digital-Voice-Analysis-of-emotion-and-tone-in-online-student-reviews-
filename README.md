# Digital-Voice-Analysis-of-emotion-and-tone-in-online-student-reviews-
Our project, "Digital Voice: Analysis of Emotion and Tone in Online Student Reviews" begins with data gathering, and data pre-processing of Coursera reviews. We focus on
enhancing data quality through text processing techniques like tokenization, stop-word
removal, and normalization. Next, for generating meaningful outcomes for the purpose of analysis we follow feature
extraction with the help of VADER tokenization and for content based features we carry
out TFIDF feature vectoring and then we sum up their scores. This allows identifying the
affective parameters and having information about the favorable topics in the comments
of students. The essence of our project is in the application of the machine learning algorithms such
as Random Forest and SVM. All of these models are employed in classifying and
determining the tones and the amount of positivity or negativity embodied in the text for
which the structured features of the reviews are extracted. In addition, we elaborate NRCLex for explaining revelation of deeper emotion other than
simple positive and negative.
